Implementation of Design Patterns with Java

## Strategy Pattern
Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable.
Useful to define abilities between classes.
When you need to use one of several behaviors dynamically.

## Observer Pattern
When you need many other objects to receive an update when another object changes
Example: Stock market with thousands of socks needs to send updates to objects 
representing individual stocks. 

## Factory Pattern
When a method returns one of several possible classes that share a common super class.
Example: A random number of enemies in a game.

## AbstractFactory Factory Pattern
It is like a factory pattern but everithing is encapsulated.
Useful when you have many objects that can be added, or change dynamically during runtime.

## Singleton Pattern
It is used when you want to eliminate the option of instantiating more than one object.
