Implementation of Design Patterns with Java

## Strategy Pattern
Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable.
Useful to define abilities between classes.
When you need to use one of several behaviors dynamically.

## Observer Pattern
When you need many other objects to receive an update when another object changes
Example: Stock market with thousands of socks needs to send updates to objects 
representing individual stocks.
